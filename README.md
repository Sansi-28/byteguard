# 🛡️ ByteGuard — Post-Quantum Secure Data Sharing Platform

> Because your data deserves protection that even a quantum computer can't crack.

ByteGuard is a full-stack encrypted file sharing platform built for researchers and teams who take security seriously. It uses **real post-quantum cryptography** — not a simulation, not a demo — actual CRYSTALS-Kyber key encapsulation running entirely in your browser, paired with AES-256-GCM symmetric encryption.

The server **never** sees your plaintext files or encryption keys. Ever.

## ✨ What It Does

- **Encrypt files** with AES-256-GCM before they ever leave your browser
- **Share encrypted files** with other users using Kyber-512 Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM)
- **Receive & decrypt** shared files using your locally-stored private key
- **Track everything** — full encryption history with export support
- **Manage access** — revoke shared file access at any time
- Zero-trust architecture: the server stores only ciphertext blobs

## 🔐 How the Crypto Works

This isn't a toy. Here's the actual pipeline:

### Encrypting a File
1. Browser generates a random **AES-256-GCM** key via WebCrypto
2. File is encrypted with that key (12-byte IV, 128-bit auth tag)
3. The encrypted blob (`IV || ciphertext`) is uploaded to the server
4. SHA-256 fingerprint is computed for integrity verification
5. Server stores the blob — it has no idea what's inside

### Sharing with Someone
1. Sender looks up the recipient's **Kyber-512 public key** from the server
2. A Kyber KEM encapsulation produces a `kemCiphertext` + `sharedSecret`
3. The AES key is XOR-wrapped with the `sharedSecret` → `wrappedKey`
4. `kemCiphertext + wrappedKey` are sent to the server alongside the share metadata
5. Recipient gets a **share code** to claim the file

### Receiving & Decrypting
1. Recipient enters the share code
2. Browser loads their **Kyber private key from IndexedDB** (never leaves the browser)
3. KEM decapsulation recovers the `sharedSecret`
4. XOR-unwrap recovers the original AES key
5. Encrypted blob is downloaded, IV is split off, AES-GCM decrypts the file
6. Plaintext file is saved locally. Done.

| **Crypto (post-quantum)** | CRYSTALS-Kyber-512 — `crystals-kyber-js` |
| **Key Storage** | Browser IndexedDB (private keys never leave the client) |
| **Auth** | JWT tokens with bcrypt password hashing |
| **Containerization** | Docker + Docker Compose + Nginx |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+** (for the Flask backend)
- **Node.js 18+** (for the React frontend)
- **Docker & Docker Compose** (optional, for containerized deployment)

### Option 1: Run Locally (Development)

**1. Clone the repo**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/saidhury/byteguard.git
cd byteguard
```

**2. Set up the backend**
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```
The Flask API will start on `http://localhost:5000`.

**3. Set up the frontend** (in a new terminal)
```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```
The Vite dev server will start on `http://localhost:5173` and proxy API requests to Flask automatically.

**4. Open your browser** and go to `http://localhost:5173`

That's it. No environment variables to configure for local dev — it just works.

### Option 2: Docker (Production-like)

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This spins up:
- `byteguard-api` — Flask + Gunicorn on port 5000
- `byteguard-ui` — Nginx serving the React build on port 80, proxying `/api` to the backend

Open `http://localhost` and you're good to go.

To tear it down:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

## 🤔 FAQ

**Is this actually post-quantum secure?**
Yes. Kyber-512 (ML-KEM-512) is the NIST-selected standard for post-quantum key encapsulation. The implementation uses the `crystals-kyber-js` library which implements the full Kyber specification in JavaScript.

**Where are my private keys stored?**
In your browser's IndexedDB, under the `ByteGuardKeyStore` database. They never leave your device. If you clear your browser data, you lose your keys — so don't do that.

**What if the server gets hacked?**
The attacker gets encrypted blobs and Kyber public keys. Without private keys (which are only in users' browsers), the data is useless. That's the whole point.

**Can I self-host this?**
Absolutely. Clone it, `docker-compose up`, done.
